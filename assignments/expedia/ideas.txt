srch.prop_id is combination of search_id and prop_id (_id of hotel)

In the train dataset, 292263 did not book, and 8358 booked. That's about 97.2% NOT booking and 2.8% booking.

- booking based on time of day of search
-- booking based on price paid for customer's previous hotels booked (visitor_hist_adr_usd)
- prop_starrating vs. price_usd (prop_id)
-+ customer reviews (prop_review_score)
- how far in advance the user is searching (srch_booking_window)
- if the search includes saturday night (srch_saturday_night_bool)
- compX_rate (Expedia vs. other providers) (X goes from 1:8)
- compX_rate_percent_diff
- getaway weekends (Saturday bool is true, country is same, time to booking is short, no kids, one room)

How to get subset of data?
srch_id goes from 1 to about 20k, with no regular increment for jumps. 
take a random sample of 500 srch_ids (each will likely have multiple observations)

Random number between 0 and 2: 1 + runif(1)
Multiply this by 10,000
