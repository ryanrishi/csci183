        <div class="container">

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Digital Audio</h2>
                    <p>Digital audio can be represented in a variety of different formats. In digital audio, sound is represented by an array or numbers. Increasing array indices corresponding to various times, and the value of each array index corresponds to the volume at that particular time. A common format is a 16-bit array with values ranging from -1 to 1. The human hearing range is from about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The Nyquist-Shannon Theorem states that a sample rate of 2x the highest frequency is possible to represent audio, so 22,050 * 2 = 44,100 samples per second. 44.1k is called the sample rate. Putting the bit depth (16 bit) and the sample rate (44.1 kHz) together, we can represent audio in a pretty accurate manner.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Web Audio API</h2>
                    <p>The Web Audio API is native browser code that allows users to render audio in the browser and create audio tools from within the browser. The types of audio tools the Web Audio API can create are waveforms (relates amplitude to time), ferquency bar graphs (mapping amplitude over frequency), and spectrograms (maps frequency and amplitude over time).</p>

                    <h4>Waveforms</h4>
                    <p>Waveforms are probably the most common way of visually representing audio data. Here is what the beginning of <i>Such Great Heights</i> by The Postal Service looks like</p>
                    <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VsVbo.png" />
                    <p>Time is on the x-domain, each sample of time represents a speaker's position between -1 and 1. Samples with a higher magnitude relate to louder noises.</p>

                    <h4>Frequency Bar Graphs</h4>
                    <p>Another popular audio tool provided by the Web Audio API is the frequency
                    bar graph. This is similar to EQ tools found in programs like <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" target="_blank">Logic</a> and <a href="http://www.avid.com/US/products/family/pro-tools" target="_blank">Pro Tools</a>.</p>
                    <p><a href="freqbar.html">Click here for a frequency bar graph demo.</a></p>
                    <p>Frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz (log scale) are on the x-domain, and the corresponding amplitude of those frequencies are represented by the height of the bar.</p>

                    <h4>Spectrograms</h4>
                    <p>The last audio tool we'll be looking at is a spectrogram. This is one of my favorite ways to represent digital audio, because it shows both frequency <i>and</i> amplitude in relation to time.</p>
                    <p><a href="spectro.html">Click here for a spectrogram demo.</a></p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, the Web Audio API cannot render spectrograms faster than real-time. This is a problem I am working on, because it would be nice to show the spectrogram without having to listen to the entire audio file.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Sound eXchange (sox)</h2>
                    <p>sox (short for <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">sound eXchange</a>) is a command-line tool that is the "Swiss Army Knife of sound processing programs". It can efficiently convert audio file types, change characters of audio files (such as sample rate and bit depth), or can simply gather statistics about audio files. I use sox primarily for the last purpose.<p>

                    <p>If I run <code>sox suchgreatheights.wav -n stat</code>, I see this:<p>
                    <table class="sox-output">
                        <tr><td>Samples read</td><td>3652062</td></tr>

                    <p>The first 40 seconds of Such Great Heights uses panning (imaging from left to right) to fill the space in the listener's aural spectrum. We can see that the left channel has a higher peak than the right channel by comparing the amplitude of the min and max levels.</p>

                    <p>Now let's say that the left channel isn't working for whatever reason. This is what we would expect to see from the above commands:</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Comparing Two Audio Files</h2>
                    <p>One way of verifying ad playback is by comparing the expected file to the audio that was actually played. There are a few factors that affect the version that actually played:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the station's DJ could have been talking over the advertisement</li>
                        <li>the audio levels on the mixing board may have been too high or too low (levels that are too high will result in clipping)</li>
                        <li>the ad may have not played at the correct time</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Any of the above factors will result in an ad that was not played correctly, and the radio station will not be paid for the incorrect playback of that advertisement.</p>

<!--                     <p>To compare the two audio files, we can use sox again. Because I am unable to use real commercials for this post, I will be using a library containing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808" target="_blank">Roland TR-808</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-909" target="_blank">Roland TR-909</a> drum machine samples. All samples have a bit depth of 16 bits and a sample rate of 44.1k.</p>

                    <p>Let's take a 808 kick and compare it to a 909 kick. The 808 kick is relatively simple: it is simply a sine wave with a low-pass filter and a VCA circuit to control the envelope. A 909 kick, on the other hand, is a bit more complex: it uses a mix of high-frequency clicks for the attack and noise passed through a low-pass filter, and eventually passed through a VCA to control the envelope.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Radio Advertisements</h2>
                    <p>Advertisements drive the radio industry. Radio stations include advertisements in their broadcasts to make money to cover costs of running the radio station. Radio advertisements reach a surprisingly large amount of people. Unlike online ads, users cannot use an ad-block program on the radio. Additionally, the majority of commuters still listen to FM radio on their way to and from work. By its nature, radio has a huge reach.</p>

                    <h3>Using the Web Audio API and Sox to Track Radio Advertisements</h3>
                    <p>Now let's put this in the context of radio advertisements. In my case, advertising agencies provide us with the advertisements, and when the radio station wishes to play an ad, all they have to do is press a button and a program will programmatically decide which ad to play in order to reach the target audience.</p>

                    <p>But what if the ad wasn't played correctly? What if the DJ was talking over the first 15 seconds of the ad? What if the faders were too high or too low? This is where SoX comes in.</p>
                    
                    <p>By comparing the characteristics of the expected audio file to the characteristics of the played audio file, we can determine if the ad was correctly played, and in turn, if the radio station will be played for the playback of the ad.</p>

                    <p>In the above example, we can clearly see that the left channel of Such Great Heights differs from the right channel. Stereo sound has a left and a right channel that are not necessarily the same, but in this case, it is clear that the audio simply did not play in the left channel. Had this been an advertisement, the radio station would not have been paid.</p>

                    <p>But doing sanity checks like above is not easy when you play tens of thousands of ads per day. Thus, we need a programmatic solution.</p>

                    <p>I am currently working on building a training set with the SoX data. The dataset has a combination of <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i> audio, and I am building models to more efficiently decide what is good and bad audio. Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to expose this information.</p>

                    <p>The skills I have learned in Data Science have very cool applications in my life. Being an audio engineer means a lot of miniscule tweaks to get <i>just</i> the right sound, and if I can do this programmatically, it makes my job easier.</p>
